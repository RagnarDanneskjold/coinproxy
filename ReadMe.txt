bitcoind-based

    This is the simplest way to set up a proxy, but it doesn't
    validate the commands sent to bitcoind.

socat-based

    socat-based version is a working solution, instructions for using
    socat are under the "socat-based" directory. This method doesn't
    validate the commands sent to bitcoind either.
